# CAM Exam - 30-Day SMS Study Program

## HOW THIS PROGRAM WORKS

### Sending Schedule
- **3 questions per day** (Morning, Midday, Evening)
- **Send the QUESTION first**, then the **ANSWER 15-30 minutes later**
- Total: **90 question slots** across 30 days

### Spaced Repetition Built In
Every concept appears **multiple times** at increasing intervals based on the Leitner system:
- **First exposure:** Day N (new concept introduced)
- **2nd exposure:** Day N+1 (next day reinforcement)
- **3rd exposure:** Day N+3 (short-term recall)
- **4th exposure:** Day N+7 (medium-term recall)
- **5th exposure:** Day N+14 or later (long-term lock-in)

Questions are tagged with `[NEW]`, `[REP-2]`, `[REP-3]`, `[REP-4]`, `[REP-5]` so you know where each falls in the repetition cycle. Repeated questions are **reworded** each time to deepen understanding rather than just pattern-match.

### Built-In Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonics** embedded directly in answers (marked with 🧠)
- **"Why it matters"** context in answers to build understanding, not just memorization
- **Trick alerts** flagged with ⚠️ for commonly missed concepts
- **Confidence builders** — easy wins mixed in with harder material
- **Interleaving** — domains are mixed within each day, not siloed

### SMS Format
Each message fits in ~160-300 characters (1-2 SMS segments). Answers are slightly longer to include the memory hook.

CAM Q: An association with $480,000 revenue needs what type of financial report?
A) Compiled

```

C) 15 business days

**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Rank from HIGHEST to LOWEST authority: Bylaws, State Law, Declaration, Rules

**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: TRUE or FALSE — A condo owner can give their neighbor a proxy to vote in a board election.
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ FALSE — No proxies for condo board elections! Must use secret written ballot.

🧠 This is the #1 exam trap. Proxies work for OTHER votes (budget, amendments) but NEVER for board elections in condos.
```

---

### 📱 Evening (6:00 PM) [REP-4 of Day 4 AM] — Concept: Board Notice (7-day recall)
**QUESTION:**

```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-2 of Day 11 AM] — Concept: SIRS (reworded)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Which components must a SIRS cover? (Select the ODD one out)
A) Roof & load-bearing walls

```

```

```

```

---

## DAY 13 — Saturday

**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: To recall a board member, you need a vote of:

```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-4 of Day 6 AM] — Concept: Lien Notice (7-day recall)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Lien notice periods: Condo = ___ days, HOA = ___ days.

B) 30 / 45
C) 45 / 60
D) 30 / 30
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) 30 days condo / 45 days HOA

🧠 "30 Condo, 45 HOA" — Condos are compact = faster. HOAs spread out = slower. Locked in!
```

**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: An HOA proxy signed on Jan 1 expires on:
A) Jan 31

```

---

Condos? Co-ops? HOAs? Timeshares? CAM licensing?
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ 718, 719, 720, 721, 468 Part VIII

🧠 If you got this instantly, it's locked in. "718-719-720-721" counts up. 468 = the license gate. FS 617 = corporate law.
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-5 of Day 1 Mid] — Concept: Three Pillars (14-day lock-in)

**QUESTION:**

```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ TRUE — Condo proxies are valid for 120 days. 106 days is within the window.

🧠 "Condo = 120, HOA = 90." June 15 would be too late for an HOA proxy but fine for a condo.

D) 1 year
```

```

🧠 "937" — 90% conveyed → 3 months to turn over. Or max 7 years regardless. Three numbers, one rule.
```

**QUESTION:**
```

A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 5

```

## DAY 17 — Wednesday

### 📱 Morning (8:00 AM) [NEW] — Concept: Commingling
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: A CAM temporarily deposits association funds into their personal account "for safekeeping." This is:
A) Acceptable if temporary
B) Prohibited — this is commingling
C) Allowed with board approval
D) Fine if documented
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) PROHIBITED. Commingling is NEVER acceptable, not even temporarily.

```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-3 of Day 13 AM] — Concept: Recall (3-day recall)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: After a valid recall vote, the board must meet to certify or reject within:
A) 3 business days
B) 5 full business days
C) 10 business days
D) 30 days
```

**ANSWER:**
```

```

---

### 📱 Evening (6:00 PM) [REP-2 of Day 16 AM] — Concept: Milestone Inspections (reworded)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: A 4-story condo is 2 miles from the coast. Phase 1 inspection due by building age:
A) 20 years
B) 25 years
C) 30 years
D) 40 years
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) 25 years — Within 3 miles of coast = year 25. Beyond 3 miles = year 30.

🧠 "Coast = 25, Inland = 30." Salt air corrodes faster, so coastal buildings get checked sooner.
```

---

## DAY 18 — Thursday

### 📱 Morning (8:00 AM) [NEW] — Concept: Safe Harbor
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: A bank forecloses on a condo unit. The "safe harbor" amount owed to the association is the LESSER of:

C) 24 months assessments or 2% of mortgage
D) All past-due assessments
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) Lesser of 12 months of assessments OR 1% of the original mortgage amount.

🧠 "12 and 1" — 12 months or 1 percent, whichever is LESS. The bank gets a break, the association gets something.
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-4 of Day 11 AM] — Concept: SIRS (7-day recall)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: TRUE or FALSE — An association can vote to use SIRS reserve funds for a new pool instead of roof repairs.
```

**ANSWER:**
```

🧠 Non-SIRS reserves? Yes, members can vote to redirect. SIRS reserves? Untouchable. Post-Surfside = no shortcuts.
```

---

### 📱 Evening (6:00 PM) [REP-5 of Day 4 AM] — Concept: Board Notice (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Without looking — board meeting notice = ___ hours. Member meeting notice = ___ days. Go!
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ 48 hours / 14 days

🧠 "48-14 Rule" — If this was instant, it's permanently locked in. ✅ One less thing to worry about on exam day.
```

---

## DAY 19 — Friday

### 📱 Morning (8:00 AM) [NEW] — Concept: Material Alterations
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Material alterations to common elements in a condo require approval of:
A) The board only
B) 51% of owners
C) 75% of owners
D) 100% of owners
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ C) 75% of all owners (unless governing documents specify differently).

🧠 "75 to alter." Major changes to shared property need a supermajority. The board can't do this alone.
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-3 of Day 16 AM] — Concept: Milestone Inspections (3-day recall)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: A Phase 1 inspection finds substantial structural deterioration. What happens next?

B) Phase 2 inspection required
C) Association is dissolved
D) Nothing, it's advisory
```

```

---

### 📱 Evening (6:00 PM) [REP-5 of Day 2 Mid] — Concept: Fiduciary Duty (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Spell out "CGL" in the context of fiduciary duty. No peeking!
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ Care, Good faith, Loyalty

🧠 If you nailed this instantly — it's LOCKED. CGL is exam gold. You'll see it in multiple questions. ✅
```

---

## DAY 20 — Saturday

### 📱 Morning (9:00 AM) [NEW] — Concept: CAM Scope
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: A board member asks the CAM for legal advice about a lawsuit. The CAM should:
A) Provide their best legal opinion
B) Decline and recommend consulting the association's attorney
C) Research the law and advise the board
D) Ask the management company's lawyer
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) Decline and refer to the attorney. A CAM is NOT a lawyer and cannot give legal advice.

🧠 "CAM ≠ Attorney, CAM ≠ Board member." The CAM implements, manages, and coordinates — but doesn't practice law or vote.
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-4 of Day 13 AM] — Concept: Recall (7-day recall)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: 200-unit condo. To recall a board member, how many votes are needed?
A) 51
B) 60
C) 101
D) 150
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ C) 101 — Majority of ALL 200 voting interests = 101.

⚠️ Not majority of those "present" or "voting." Majority of ALL interests. Every. Single. One. Counts.
```

---

### 📱 Evening (6:00 PM) [REP-5 of Day 3 Eve] — Concept: Declaration (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: What document creates the condominium, defines units & common elements, and is filed with the county?

```

---

## DAY 21 — Sunday
*Week 3 review + new concepts*

### 📱 Morning (9:00 AM) [REP-5 of Day 5 AM] — Concept: Financial Thresholds (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Rapid fire — what financial report is needed at each level?
$100K revenue? $200K? $400K? $600K?
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ $100K = Cash report | $200K = Compiled | $400K = Reviewed | $600K = Audited

🧠 "1-3-5 Climb": Under $150K=cash, $150K=compiled, $300K=reviewed, $500K=audited. If instant → LOCKED ✅
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [NEW] — Concept: Contracting
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Association records belong to:
A) The management company
B) The CAM personally
C) The association
D) The board president
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ C) The ASSOCIATION — always. Even if the management company maintains them.

⚠️ Exam trap: If a management company is fired, they must return ALL records. Records are never "theirs."
```

---

### 📱 Evening (6:00 PM) [REP-5 of Day 6 AM] — Concept: Lien Notice (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Lien notice: Condo = ___ days. HOA = ___ days. Condo lien effective for ___ year(s). Go!
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ Condo = 30 days | HOA = 45 days | Lien effective = 1 year

```

---

```
CAM Q: "Replacement cost" insurance differs from "actual cash value" because:
A) It includes a profit margin
B) It does NOT deduct for depreciation
C) It's always cheaper
D) It only covers common elements
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) Replacement cost = full cost to replace, NO depreciation deduction.

🧠 "Replacement = FULL price. ACV = depreciated price." Associations should insure for full replacement cost.
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-5 of Day 7 AM] — Concept: Insurance Types (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Match: Fidelity bond=___, D&O=___, HO-6=___, Workers comp=___

D) Liability, Structure, Theft, Fire
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ A) Fidelity=Theft, D&O=Board liability, HO-6=Owner's interior, Workers comp=Employee injuries

🧠 Each insurance has ONE job. Fidelity=money theft. D&O=decision protection. HO-6=owner's stuff. WC=employee hurt.
```

---

### 📱 Evening (6:00 PM) [REP-4 of Day 15 AM] — Concept: Turnover (7-day recall)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: The "937 rule" for developer turnover means:

B) 90% conveyed → 3 months to turn over, OR max 7 years
C) $9M budget, 3 board members, 7 year term
D) 9 buildings, 3 phases, 7 year warranty
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) 90% conveyed → 3 months, OR 7 years max.

🧠 "937" — three digits, one rule. If you see turnover on the exam, think 937 immediately.
```

---

## DAY 23 — Tuesday

**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Under Robert's Rules, the correct order for conducting business is:
A) Discussion → Motion → Vote
B) Motion → Second → Discussion → Vote
C) Vote → Motion → Discussion
D) Second → Motion → Vote
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) Motion → Second → Discussion → Vote

🧠 "MSDV" — "Motions Should Drive Votes." Someone proposes, someone agrees to discuss, everyone talks, then votes.
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-5 of Day 8 AM] — Concept: Elections (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: TRUE or FALSE — Proxies can be used for condo board elections.

B) Condos, co-ops, and timeshares
C) Only condos
D) All community associations
```

**ANSWER:**
```
✅ B) Condos, co-ops, and timeshares. NOT HOAs!

⚠️ Exam trap: DBPR does NOT regulate HOAs. HOAs fall under FS 720 with different enforcement mechanisms.
```

---

### 📱 Midday (12:30 PM) [REP-5 of Day 9 AM] — Concept: Quorum (14-day lock-in)
**QUESTION:**

**QUESTION:**
```
CAM Q: Can SIRS reserves be waived? Can OTHER reserves be waived? Answer both.
