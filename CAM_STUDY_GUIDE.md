# Domain 1: Governance & Compliance (23%)

*This is the LARGEST domain on the exam. Think of it as the "rules of the game."*

## 1.1 What Is a Community Association?

**Definition:** Real or personal property owned by two or more entities who share responsibility for maintenance and administration costs.

### The Three Pillars of a Community Association
> **Memory trick: "MLV" = Membership, Lien, Vote**
1. **Membership is mandatory** - You buy in, you're a member. No opt-out.
2. **Members have the right to vote** - Democracy in action.
3. **Assessments, if unpaid, can become a lien** on the member's property.

### Types of Community Associations

| Type | FL Statute | Key Feature | Memory Hook |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Condominium** | FS 718 | Own your unit + undivided share of common elements | "718 = Seven-One-Eight, Condo is Great" |
| **Cooperative** | FS 719 | Own shares in a corporation that owns the building | "719 = Co-op is Fine" |
| **HOA** | FS 720 | Own your lot + mandatory membership | "720 = HOA Plenty" |
| **Timeshare** | FS 721 | Right to use property for a specific time period | "721 = Time for Fun" |

### Condominium Subtypes (FS 718)
- **Residential Condo** - Dwelling units only
- **Commercial Condo** - Business/office units
- **Mixed-Use Condo** - Contains BOTH residential AND non-residential units
- **Phase Condo** - Built and sold in phases
- **Multicondominium** - Multiple condos sharing common elements

## 1.2 Governing Documents (Hierarchy Matters!)

> **Memory trick: "SLAP the BRAD" - from highest to lowest authority**
> **S**tatutes > **L**aws > **A**rticles > **P**lat... then **B**ylaws > **R**ules > **A**mendments > **D**eclarations

**Actual hierarchy (simplified):**
1. **Federal & State Law** (always trumps everything)
2. **Declaration of Condominium / CC&Rs** (the "constitution" of the association)
3. **Articles of Incorporation** (creates the legal entity)
4. **Bylaws** (operating procedures - HOW the association runs)
5. **Rules & Regulations** (day-to-day rules adopted by the board)

### Key Document Facts
- **Declaration** = Filed with the county, creates the condo, defines units & common elements
- **Articles of Incorporation** = Filed with FL Division of Corporations under FS 617 (Not-for-Profit Corporation Act)
- **Bylaws** = Internal governance rules (quorum requirements, officer duties, meeting procedures)
- **Prospectus** = Disclosure document given to buyers BEFORE purchase

## 1.3 The Board of Directors

### Board Basics
- Board members have a **fiduciary duty** to the association (duty of care, loyalty, and good faith)
- Board members are **NOT required to be licensed** CAMs
- Board members serve **staggered terms** to ensure continuity
- Board must have at least **3 members** (typical)

### Fiduciary Duty - The "CGL" Rule
> **C**are - Act with reasonable care and diligence  
> **G**ood Faith - Act honestly, no hidden agendas  
> **L**oyalty - Put the association's interests above your own

### What the Board CAN Do vs. CANNOT Do
| Board CAN | Board CANNOT |
|-----------|-------------|
| Adopt rules & regulations | Amend the Declaration (needs owner vote) |
| Approve budgets | Waive reserves without owner vote |
| Hire/fire the CAM | Spend beyond budget without approval |
| Enter contracts (with limits) | Deny access to official records |
| Levy assessments | Discriminate (Fair Housing Act) |

### Developer Control & Turnover
- **Developer controls the board** until turnover
- **Turnover triggers** (whichever occurs first):
  - 3 months after 90% of units are conveyed
  - When the developer no longer holds majority
  - 7 years after recording of declaration (for condos)
- At turnover, developer must provide ALL association records

## 1.4 The CAM License (FS 468, Part VIII)

# Domain 2: Financial Management (22%)

*Second largest domain. Think of it as "follow the money."*

## 2.1 Budgets

### Budget Basics
- The board **must adopt an annual budget**
- Budget must include **both operating expenses AND reserves**
- Members must receive the proposed budget **at least 14 days** before the budget meeting (condos/co-ops)

### Budget Components
> **Memory trick: "ORUM" = Operations, Reserves, Utilities, Maintenance**

1. **Operating Budget** - Day-to-day expenses (landscaping, management fees, utilities, insurance)
2. **Reserve Budget** - Long-term savings for major repairs/replacements

### The Budget Process
1. Manager prepares proposed budget
2. Board reviews and adjusts
3. Notice sent to members (14 days for condos)
4. Budget meeting held (open to all members)
5. Board adopts the budget
6. Assessments are set based on adopted budget

## 2.2 Assessments

### Types of Assessments
| Type | Purpose | Who Approves |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Regular/Maintenance** | Covers annual budget | Board |
| **Special Assessment** | Unexpected or large expenses | Board (but may need owner vote depending on amount/docs) |
| **Emergency Assessment** | Urgent, unforeseen needs | Board (limited circumstances) |

### Assessment Collection
- Assessments are the **lifeblood** of the association
- Due dates set in governing documents
- **Late fees** can be charged if authorized in documents
- **Interest** can accrue on unpaid assessments (max rate per statute)

### Lien & Collection Process
> **Memory trick: "NAIL" = Notice, Assess, Interest, Lien**

1. Assessment becomes past due
2. **Intent to Lien letter** sent (must be sent by certified mail at least **30 days** before recording lien for condos)
3. **Claim of Lien** recorded with county
4. Lien is effective for **1 year** from recording date (condos - FS 718)
5. Association can **foreclose** on the lien

### Key Assessment Rules
- A condo association lien is effective for **1 year** after the claim of lien is recorded
- HOA lien (FS 720) - must be claimed within **1 year** of assessment becoming due
- **First mortgage holder** has priority over association liens (except for "safe harbor" amount)
- **Safe harbor (condos):** When a first mortgagee forecloses, they owe the LESSER of: 12 months of assessments OR 1% of the original mortgage amount

## 2.3 Reserves

### What Are Reserves?
Funds set aside for **major repair and replacement** of common elements with a deferred maintenance expense of $10,000+ and useful life of 2+ years.

### Reserve Requirements (Condos - FS 718)
- **Structural Integrity Reserve Study (SIRS)** - Required for buildings 3+ stories, must be completed by December 31, 2024
- SIRS must cover: roof, load-bearing walls, foundation, floor, plumbing, electrical, waterproofing, windows, fire protection
- Reserves for items identified in SIRS **CANNOT be waived or reduced** (as of 2025)
- Other reserves CAN be waived by majority vote of members

### Reserve Funding Methods
| Method | Description | Memory Hook |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Straight-line** | Equal annual contributions over useful life | "Steady Eddie" |
| **Cash-flow** | Variable contributions based on timing of needs | "Flex Fund" |
| **Threshold** | Maintain minimum balance | "Safety Net" |

### Key Reserve Rules
- Reserves are **NOT** general operating funds
- Using reserves for other purposes requires **membership vote** (except SIRS reserves)
- Reserve study should be updated at least every **10 years** (SIRS every 10 years)
- Board must **disclose** reserve funding status in annual financial report

## 2.4 Financial Reporting & Controls

### Required Financial Reports (Condos - Based on Revenue)
| Annual Revenue | Required Report |
|---------------|----------------|
| Under $150,000 | Report of cash receipts & expenditures |
| $150,000 - $299,999 | Compiled financial statements |
| $300,000 - $499,999 | Reviewed financial statements |
| $500,000+ | Audited financial statements |

> **Memory trick for thresholds: "1-3-5 Climb"**  
> Under **1**50K = Cash report  
> **3**00K = Reviewed  
> **5**00K = Audited  

### Internal Controls
- **Separation of duties** - No single person should control all financial functions
- **Two signatures** required on checks over a certain amount
- **Monthly financial statements** to the board
- **Bank reconciliations** performed monthly
- Fidelity bond/insurance for anyone handling funds

### Commingling is PROHIBITED

---

# Domain 3: Risk Management (12%)

*Think of this as "protecting the association from disaster."*

## 3.1 Insurance Requirements

### Required Insurance for Condos (FS 718)
| Type | What It Covers | Who Carries It |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Property/Hazard** | Building structure, common elements | Association |

| **Fidelity Bond** | Employee theft/dishonesty | Association |
| **Workers' Comp** | Employee injuries on the job | Association (if employees) |
| **HO-6 (Unit Owner)** | Interior of unit, personal property, liability | Individual owner |

### Key Insurance Concepts

**Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value**
- **Replacement Cost** = Cost to replace with similar quality (NO depreciation deduction)
- **Actual Cash Value** = Replacement cost MINUS depreciation
- Associations should insure for **full insurable replacement cost**

**The "Studs-Out" vs. "All-In" Rule**
- **Condo association** typically insures from the **studs out** (structure, common elements)
- **Unit owner** insures from the **studs in** (interior finishes, personal property)
- Check the Declaration - it defines the boundary

### Fidelity Bond Requirements
- Must cover **all persons who control or disburse funds**

### Risk Management Strategies
> **Memory trick: "RATE" = Retain, Avoid, Transfer, Eliminate**

1. **Retain** - Accept the risk (self-insure small risks)
2. **Avoid** - Don't engage in the risky activity
3. **Transfer** - Buy insurance or shift risk via contracts
4. **Eliminate** - Remove the hazard entirely

### Safety & Compliance

# Domain 5: Property Maintenance (14%)

*This domain increased in weight. Think "preserve and protect property values."*

## 5.1 Common Elements vs. Limited Common Elements

| Type | Definition | Examples | Who Maintains |
|------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Common Elements** | Owned by all owners jointly | Lobby, pool, roof, elevators, parking lot | Association |
| **Limited Common Elements** | Common elements reserved for specific unit(s) | Assigned parking space, balcony, storage unit | Usually association (check Declaration) |

- Schedule **regular inspections** of all common elements

### Capital Improvement vs. Maintenance
| Capital Improvement | Maintenance/Repair |

- **Termination** - How either party can end the contract
- **Insurance requirements** - Manager must carry E&O, fidelity, liability
- **Indemnification** - Who is responsible for what

### Manager vs. Employee
| Manager (Independent Contractor) | Employee |
|--------------------------------|----------|
| Sets own schedule | Association sets schedule |
| Uses own tools/equipment | Uses association's tools |
| Serves multiple clients | Works exclusively for association |
| Receives 1099 | Receives W-2 |
| No benefits required | Benefits may be required |

## 6.2 Competitive Bidding

### When to Get Bids
- **Any major expenditure** (threshold varies by association)
- **Capital improvements**
- **Service contracts** (landscaping, janitorial, security)
- Best practice: **3 bids minimum** for significant contracts

### Evaluating Bids
> **Memory trick: "PRICE" isn't everything**
> **P**erformance history  
> **R**eferences  
> **I**nsurance coverage  
> **C**ost  
> **E**xperience

## 6.3 Contract Types

| Type | Description | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Fixed Price** | Set price for defined scope | Low risk for association |
| **Time & Materials** | Pay for actual time + materials | Higher risk, less predictable |

# Memory Tricks & Mnemonics

## The Statute Number System
> **"718-719-720-721 = Condo-Coop-HOA-Time"**  
> Think of it as counting up: each number = next type of community

## The Three Pillars: "MLV"
> **M**embership mandatory, **L**ien if unpaid, **V**ote is a right

## Fiduciary Duty: "CGL"
> **C**are, **G**ood faith, **L**oyalty (like a CGL insurance policy protects the board)

## Financial Thresholds: "1-3-5 Climb"
> **$1**50K = Compiled  
> **$3**00K = Reviewed  
> **$5**00K = Audited  
> (Under $150K = just a cash report)

## Notice Periods: "48-14 Rule"
> **48 hours** = Board meetings (think: 2 days for the small group)  
> **14 days** = Member meetings (think: 2 weeks for the big group)

## Lien Notice: "30 for Condo, 45 for HOA"
> Condos are faster (30 days), HOAs take longer (45 days)  
> Think: "Condos are more **compact** = faster process"

## Proxy Validity: "120 Condo, 90 HOA"
> Condos give you **more time** (120 days)  
> HOAs give you **less time** (90 days)  
> Think: "Condos are **taller** = longer proxy life"

## Risk Management: "RATE"
> **R**etain, **A**void, **T**ransfer, **E**liminate

# Exam Day Tips

## Before the Exam
1. **Get a good night's sleep** - Don't cram the night before
2. **Arrive early** - At least 30 minutes before your appointment
3. **Bring valid ID** - Government-issued photo ID required
4. **Know the location** - Visit the testing center beforehand if possible

## During the Exam
1. **You have plenty of time** - 2.5-3 hours for ~120 questions = ~1.5 min per question
2. **Read every question TWICE** - Your brain can trick you into misreading
3. **Read ALL answer choices** before selecting - The "best" answer may be the last one
4. **Eliminate obviously wrong answers first** - Improves your odds
5. **When stumped, pick the longest answer** - Test writers often make correct answers more detailed
6. **Use the true/false trick** - Evaluate each multiple-choice option as true/false independently
7. **Flag and skip** difficult questions - Come back to them later
8. **Don't change answers** unless you're certain - Your first instinct is usually right
9. **Watch for absolute words** - "Always," "Never," "All," "None" are usually wrong
10. **Look for qualifying words** - "Usually," "Generally," "May" are often in correct answers

## Key Mindset
- **The exam tests MINIMUM competency** - You don't need to be an expert
- **Focus on what a REASONABLE manager would do** - Not the perfect answer, the BEST answer
- **When in doubt, choose the answer that PROTECTS the association** and follows the law
- **Remember: the CAM works FOR the board, not AS the board** - Don't overstep
